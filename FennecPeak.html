				<h1>Project Overview</h1>
				<p>
					Fennec Peak is a 2-4 player, local multiplayer game.
					It was created in a seven week project with twelve team members.
					In the game, players fight each other to be the last one standing by knocking each other off of the
					steep edges that surround the level.
					To reach that goal, they must make use of their snappy movement, attacks and objects in the
					environment.	
				</p>
				<p>
					My role in this project was to assign and have a look out on time needed for programming tasks to be
					completed as well as implemented the more complicated systems while also helping out other team
					members with programming related issues.
					I have created and guided the team through a system for easier in-game menu editing and implemented
					the new Unity Input system without which, the local multiplayer in the game would not be possible.
					For the input system, I have designed a structure for other programmers to code in, in order to
					maintain modularity of the code and significantly reduce bottleneck caused by multiple programmers
					having to work on the same script.

				<h1>UI System</h1>
				<img src="Fennec_Peak/HUD_Hierarchy.png" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;">
				<p>
					The UI system has been written with the goal of allowing other team members to
					quickly easily set up fully working UI elements. Setting up a new UI page 
					only requires the user to create an empty gameObject, add a premade component to it
					and fill it with desired UI elements. A UI page or element with custom functionality
					can also be created by creating a new class and connecting it with the already existing system.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here will be a description of how it works in detail.
